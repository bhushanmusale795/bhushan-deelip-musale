				The La Voiture Noire (The Black Car)
				Was a special edition car built and sold
				by Bugatti in 2019.<br><br>
				Only 1 of these cars was built and sold 
				for a price of $12.5 millions; <br><br>
				masking it the most expensive new car ever sold.
				A pioneering spirit, 
				passion for perfection and the desire to continually redefine its
				limits have been the key characteristics of BUGATTI since it was founded more
				than 110 years ago .<br><br> None of the brands masterpieces reflect these values more
				impressively than the Type 57 SC Atlantic.<br><br> Created by Ettore Bugatti’s eldest son
				Jean, the only four Atlantics ever created stand for pure elegance and sophistication.<br><br>
				With its homage to the fourth, all-black Atlantic, missing since the Second World
				War, BUGATTI is bringing the speed, technology, luxury and aesthetics of an icon
				into a new era.<br><br> But the customized creation of “La Voiture Noire” is far more than
				a modern interpretation of the ghost of the gran turismo. <br><br>La Voiture Noire is a
				tribute to BUGATTIs own history, a manifesto of the BUGATTI aesthetic and a piece
				of automotive haute couture.<br><br>

			<h1>BUGATTI DEVELOPS UNIQUE HYPER SPORTS CAR FOR A BUGATTI ENTHUSIAST.</h1>
			<p>
				the successful continuation of their heritage poses a challenge for
				traditional companies.<br><br> once again, the french luxury brand bugatti
				has shown that it can transform these challenges into unique
				models. with its one-off car la voiture noire1 bugatti has again
				proved that it makes the worlds most powerful, most luxurious and
				most exclusive hyper sports cars.<br><br> the true form of luxury is
				individuality. la voiture noire is now at the cutting edge of
				automobile production. it is a sculptural beauty with unique
				technology, the ideal grand tourisme, says bugatti president
				stephan winkelmann. this is a coupe with the comfort of a luxury
				limousine and the power of a hyper sports car.

				A pioneering spirit, a passion for perfection and the desire to continually redefine
				its limits have been the key characteristics of Bugatti since the brand was
				established 110 years ago. Our history is both a privilege and a responsibility –
				the responsibility for continuing the Bugatti heritage into the future. With La
				Voiture Noire, we are paying homage to our heritage and bringing speed,
				technology, luxury and aesthetics forward to a new era, says Stephan
				Winkelmann.<br><br> The new hyper sports car reflects Bugatti’s French heritage and its
				French identity – elegance through minimalism and refinement through
				intensification. This is a tailor-made creation only comparable with the haute
				couture of exclusive Paris fashion designers.

			<h1>La Voiture Noire - more than a reinterpretation</h1>
			<p>
				La Voiture Noire is a far more than a modern interpretation of Jean Bugattis Type
				57 SC Atlantic. It is a feast of aesthetics, says Stephan Winkelmann. With its
				extended front end and the distinctive Bugatti C-line, the Voiture Noire creates
				an elongated impression with the elegant waistline defining the contours of the
				coupe.<br><br> Purism and elegance are reflected in the surfaces and the clear lines. The
				bumpers are smoothly integrated into the body and the windscreen seems to flow
				seamlessly into the windows at the sides like the visor on a helmet. Without any
				irritating lines, the surface is “all of a piece” and there is nothing to disturb the
				optical flow. This means that the hyper sports car has changed its attitude and
				become a grand tourisme – ideal for comfortable travel on long trips.<br><br>
				The heart of the new creation is the iconic 16-cylinder engine – unique in the
				automotive world and the peak of the engineer’s art. This is not only an engine
				but the heart of the vehicle and a technical masterpiece. There is no other car in
				the world with such an engine.<br><br> It is not only extremely powerful but also beautiful
				to look at, Stephan Winkelmann enthuses. The 16-cylinder engine with a
				displacement of 8 litres develops 1,103 kW/1,500 PS and 1,600 Newton-metres
				of torque. Six tailpipes at the rear bear witness to its incredible power and are also
				a tribute to the 16 cylinders.
				For €11 million (before tax) this unique car has already been sold to a Bugatti
				enthusiast. It is the most expensive new car of all time. The car enthusiast is
				fascinated by the Atlantic; with the “Voiture Noire“, he has acquired a vehicle that
				takes up the legend and carries the idea forward to the present day. In its
				exclusiveness, style, quality and performance, La Voiture Noire is an
				unprecedented and unique car that continues a long tradition in the history of the automobile.
