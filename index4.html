<h1>Rolls Royce Sweptails</h1>

<p>
The automotive equivalent of haute
couture, Sweptail is the result of
inspiration from a special patron'section
admiration of his favourite cars of the
early 20th Century.<br><br>This is a one-off large 
Today, personalizing a car usually means picking a special paint color or interior trim.
But in the 1920s and 1930s, the world’s wealthiest buyers went a lot further than that.
In those prewar years, it was the norm for luxury cars to be decked out in completely
custom bodywork.<br><br> Now, Rolls-Royce is trying to bring that back.
Unveiled at the 2017 Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este, the Rolls-Royce Sweptail is
a one-off commission created for a customer with very specific tastes, and very
deep pockets. Said customer approached Rolls in 2013 about building a one-off
car, and the automaker’s design department spent several years bringing the idea
to reality.<br><br>
The “Sweptail” name and design reference swept-tail Rolls-Royce designs from
the 1920s. The car, which appears to be based on the now-defunct Phantom
Coupe, features a fastback roof that ends in a pointed tail, a design flourish rarely
seen today.<br><br> Virtually all of that roof is covered in glass, which should make for quite
a view, but also ensures the air conditioning will be running on full blast on sunny days.
At the front, the Sweptail features a massive grille, the largest on any modern Rolls,
according to the company.<br><br> It was milled from a solid chunk of aluminum, and hand
polished to a mirror finish. The rest of the front fascia is framed in a brushed
aluminum ring, further emphasizing its considerable width.<br><br>
Despite being a very large car, the Sweptail only seats two. The space behind the
rear seats is taken up by a wood-covered luggage shelf, which looks like someone
inserted a section of deck from a yacht into the cabin. As with all Rolls cars, the
interior is trimmed in high-end wood and leather.<br><br> Designers also tried to eliminate
as much switchgear as possible from the dashboard to create a cleaner look, and
found space in the door sills for attaché cases, each designed to hold a laptop.<br><br> The
finishing touch is a champagne cooler in the center console. Drinking and driving
is still illegal in most places, of course.<br><br>
How much does all of this opulence cost? Rolls would not disclose a price, but
CEO Torsten Müller-Otvös believes it could be the “most expensive new car ever,”
according to Motor1.<br><br> Rolls may build other one-off cars in the future, although it
reportedly won’t repeat the process it went through to make the Sweptail. Rather
than take requests from customers, Rolls may build special cars itself, and then sell them off.

<h1>A Detailed Look At The Luxurious Rolls Royce Sweptail</h1>



<p>
Rolls Royce cars are known for being expensive, bank-breaking luxury vehicles that offer class
and style. But their one-off luxury car produced in 2017 definitely takes the cake.<br><br>
It is right up there with the Rolls Royce Silver Ghost as one of the more expensive Rolls Royce cars ever made.<br><br>
The luxurious Rolls Royce Sweptail debuted in May of 2017. And with its debut came a
massive price tag and the title of the most expensive new car in the world.
At $12 million, the unique full-sized luxury grand tourer from Rolls Royce was dubbed the
most costly vehicle on Earth.<br><br> Although two years later, this title would be taken by Bugatti’s La
Voiture Noire, which is priced at $18 million. This luxury vehicle by Rolls Royce enunciated
the company’s claim to the coachbuilding throne.<br><br>
According to Rolls Royce, the inspiration for the design of the Sweptail came about when a
customer requested a one-of-a-kind car. One that got its inspiration from luxury yachts of the 1920s and '30s.
A notable and distinct feature of the Sweptail is no doubt its one-piece glass roof. This roof
disappears into the back of the car, giving it a unique “sweptail” look.<br><br>
Moving to the front end of the Sweptail, you will find a grille larger than that of any modern
Rolls Royce vehicle. What's more unique about it is that it is put together from one piece of
hand-polished aluminum.<br><br>
The luxury two-seat and two-door coupe have all the makings of a modern, ultra-luxury car. If
you’re looking for class and luxury, then you should want to own a Rolls Royce, even more so,
a Sweptail.<br><br>

A simple but elegant look along with a contemporary but classical feel gives the driver a
welcome contrast. From polished Macassar ebony to dark spice seat and armrest leathers, the
interior of the Rolls Royce Sweptail is everything luxury.<br><br>
Occupants of this multimillion-dollar full-sized luxury grand tourer from Rolls are spoiled
with a feature called Passerelle. The rear of the Sweptail’s interior carries this feature seat - an
expansive size of fine wood along with a hat shelf.<br><br>
One unique fact about this car is the absence of the car’s name on the exterior of the car.
Rather, very observant occupants will find the name Sweptail on the surface of its hat shelf.
Another is the outboard walls of both sides of the car concealing 2 similar panniers. Upon
activation, each of these panniers will deploy a custom-made attaché case that can hold a laptop.<br><br>
These 2 cases are uniquely hand-made from carbon fiber with a wrapping of fine leather to
match the car’s interior.<br><br> There is also a full set of luggage from Rolls Royce that owners can find in the trunk.
The trunk interior is almost as luxurious as the inside of the car.<br><br> You will find it covered with
similar wood to the hat shelf, while an aluminum luggage rail completes the trunk.<br><br>
Another truly stylish thing about the Sweptail is its mechanism that gives you a personalized
feel to the car. The center console is home to this mechanism that is hand-built and activates
when you push a button.<br><br>
