<h1>pagani Zonda Barchetta costs</h1>

<p>
The Pagani Zonda HP Barchetta is
based on mid engined Pagani Zonda
which was originally manufactured 19 Years ago.<br><br>
The car will not have any kind of
attachable or convertible top.
Fifteen million Euros, ladies and gentlemen.<br><br> Pagani has confirmed that its rare Zonda HP
Barchetta special will cost €15m – or a cool £13.4m. However, only three are being made and
none are available. Oh cruel, cruel world.<br><br>
A couple of weekends ago, a delectable convoy of Paganis (estimated to be worth some £35m)
snaked their way from the company’s UK HQ in north London, through central and down to the
Goodwood Festival of Speed.<br><br>
And heading up that convoy was Horacio Pagani’s personal Zonda HP Barchetta. The other two
he plans on building have already been pre-sold, as mentioned.
Still, €15m. Fifteen. And million.<br><br> The Zonda HP Barchetta, first seen last year, boasts a 6.0-litre
biturbo V12 on board with 789bhp, the same power output of the wild Huayra BC.<br><br> It’s matched
to a six-speed manual gearbox, along with a mechanical locking diff and rear-wheel-drive.<br><br>
It mirrors the BC’s suspension setup too, and features massive brakes: 380m ventilated discs all
round with six-piston calipers up front and four piston calipers at the back.<br><br> A neat touch is what
these monster brakes hide behind: the 20in front and 21in rear forged aluminium wheels have
different colour inlays left and right. It’s all about details with Pagani.<br><br>
The most striking aspect about the Zonda Barchetta – aside from the price and the fact the
Zonda still exists in some form – is that body. Gorgeous, isn’t it? The rear wheel fairings are
made from carbon fibre. It gets a roof scoop… but no actual roof.<br><br>
Instead, you’ll see a wraparound windscreen, no doubt allowing you freedom to contemplate on
your exclusive, 1,250kg, 789bhp purchase.<br><br>
Other special edition Paganis on display included the Zonda Olivier Evolution – a one-off version
of the 760 RS Zonda – and Huayra Roadster.<br><br>
The Pagani Zonda HP Barchetta is special. You know that because it carries the initials of its creator, Horacio Pagani
in its name - something no other Zonda has. It is also deliberately impractical, with a permanent roofless layout and
cropped wraparound windshield.<br><br> There will only ever be three HP Barchettas made, one of which Horacio will keep
for himself and the other two already called for. But these are all plain facts until you see the price. Rs 121 crore
approximately (15 million euros). No decimal error, this. For the record, the recent one-off Rolls-Royce Sweptail is priced at around Rs 89 crore.
The boutique hypercar maker had shown off the Pagani Zonda HP Barchetta. one of its rarest cars to be ever made,
during the Monterey Car Week at Pebble Beach, California in August 2017.<br><br> The Barchetta was designed to celebrate
the 60th birthday of the brand's creator Horacio Pagani by him and his team.<br><br>
The HP Barchetta is based on the popular mid-engined Pagani Zonda hypercar that was first created 19 years ago,
and the HP Barchetta on display here is one of only three to ever be built. It had led a rally of other Paganis from
company's UK headquarters in London to the recent Goodwood Festival of Speed.<br><br>
Even bigger news is that this once-poster-car for many youngsters who grew up in the late 1990s may cease to be
produced after these three Barchettas are made and delivered.<br><br> Pagani had replaced the Zonda with the Huayra in
2011, and even the latter had already ended its limited 100-car production run by 2015.<br><br>
The Pagani Zonda HP Barchetta is created by the Uno-di-Uno (one of one) division, a team of specialists that create
one-off and extremely rare customised cars that exceed even the Zonda's and Huayra's already high-quality
standards. It reflects the Zonda that Horacio wanted for himself.<br><br>
The roofless design is absolutely bonkers as it has no option for an attachable or convertible soft or hard-top.
Among the noteworthy design elements is a cropped windshield, carbon-titanium composite components from the
Huayra and contrasting wheels wherein those on the left side are silver, while those on the right are blue.<br><br> The rear
wheels also get small fairings that cover a third of the wheel well.
Seats in the Barchetta's cabin feature ivory leather with tartan elements and blue leather highlights. The steering
wheel is also trimmed in blue leather and wood as an homage to vintage racing cars. <br><br>The Pagani Zonda HP
Barchetta is powered by a 7.3-litre Mercedes-AMG M120 V12 engine, mated to a six-speed manual transmission.

<p>
Pagani does not believe in manufacturing run-off-the-mill cars. Their cars
are ridiculously niche with eye-watering performance figures and price tags
as well.<br><br> And this time, Pagani has broken all records with the Zonda HP
Barchetta. By breaking all records, we mean in terms of pricing, but with a
789 hp V12 on board, it is bound to munch on some supercars as well.<br><br> Only
three examples of the Pagani Zonda HP Barchetta will exist in the world,
with one under the ownership of Pagani chief Horacio Pagani and the
others that are yet to be built have been pre-ordered.<br><br>
Zonda HP Barchetta boasts a 6.0-litre biturbo V12 on board that makes 789
bhp, the same power output of the Huayra BC.<br><br> The engine is paired with a
six-speed manual gearbox, along with a mechanical locking diff and rear-wheel-drive.<br><br>
The Zonda HP Barchetta also has the same suspension setup as the Huayra
BC and is fitted with massive brakes – 380m ventilated discs all round with
six-piston callipers up front and four piston callipers at the back.<br><br>
The Pagani Zonda HP Barchetta carries a price tag of €15 million or to make
it sound worse – over Rs 121 crore.
