<h1>Mercedes-Benz Maybach Exelero</h1>

<p>
The Maybach Exelero is a one-off
high-performance sports car made by Stola in collaboration with Daimler
Chrysler.<br><br>It was unveiled at the Tempodrom in Berlin in 2005.
When you build a car to go really fast, part of the design process includes testing some seriously
tough rubber in a tyre-torture chamber.<br><br> As vital as this stage is, the thought of testing tyres is
enough to send me into a coma of sheer boredom
But before I drop off while envisioning such experiments, I must acknowledge that there is a much
more interesting way of testing tyres. And that way is called the Maybach Exelero.<br><br>
While the Exelero might give the appearance of a vehicle designed to adorn a peculiar corner at
Pebble Beach, or crawl at a snail's pace through an obnoxious rapper's "music" video, you can think
of it more accurately as a mobile tyre testing device.<br><br>
While that description still doesn't evoke much enthusiasm, the way in which this car tests tyres is
enough to set every petrol head's hair on fire. For this satanic looking car is truly unlike anything
that's ever been made before or since. And this is the story behind it.<br><br>
The Exelero project came to life in 2003 at the behest of Fulda Tyres – the German division of
The Exelero project came to life in 2003 at the behest of Fulda Tyres – the German division of Goodyear – who were developing a high performance tyre called the Fulda Carat Exelero. <br><br>
You can think of the car then not only as Fulda's way of testing their tyres – but also as a way of promoting
them; partly because of the eponymous link between the tyres and the car, but also because of the
extreme nature of the test Fulda specified.<br><br>
Their requirements to Maybach were simple: build a car that can take our 315mm inch-thick tyres
to 350kph (217mph). Oh, and don't worry about making the car light. After all, a heavy car will put
more strain on the tyres, further proving their credentials.<br><br>
The Excelero doesn't mark the first time Fulda have requested a car for the job of testing a
performance tyre. All the way back in 1938, a vehicle called the W38 Stromlinienfahrzeug was the
car entrusted with doing the Exelero's job - nearly 70 years before it came to be. <br><br>
For the W38 however, Fulda didn't initially approach Maybach themselves. Instead, they went to
coachbuilders Dorr & Schreck, and requested they build a car that could maintain a speed of
200kph (124mph) for the purposes of testing high performance tyres. D&S accepted the challenge;
after which, they chose to collaborate with Maybach Motorenbau (as they were known back then),
and aerodynamicist Freiherr Reinhard Koenig Fachsenfeld. What a shame that his name wasn't as
streamlined as his car turned out to be!<br><br>
When you look at the old W38 and compare its profile with the newer Exelero, their sleekness
radiates a family resemblance. And that's just one of a couple of similarities between the way the
two cars were developed. <br><br>

<h1>Impressive sports coupé: Maybach Exelero</h1>

<p>
The Maybach Exelero is a very special concept car in that it was created in cooperation with tyre
producer Fulda. For the testing of high-performance tyres, the company needed a car that was capable
of exceeding the 350 km/h mark.<br><br> A Maybach model had been built to serve as a test car for Fulda as
early as the late 1930s – and this connection was revived a couple of years ago. The final result was
more than convincing: on May 1, 2005, racing driver Klaus Ludwig drove the Maybach Exelero fitted with
Fulda tyres in Nardo/Italy and attained a speed of 351.45 km/h – setting a new world speed record for
limousines on series-production tyres.<br><br>
The Maybach Exelero combines the elegance and first-class quality of a high-end limousine with the
silky-smooth power of a sports coupé.<br><br> It is a car which attains a top speed of over 350 km/h – with an
unladen weight of 2.66 tons and the dimensions of a small van. For this car, a tyre was designed that
not only coped with the above-mentioned weight, dimensions, and speed, but also gave the car safety,
stability, and comfort.<br><br>
The project team started working on the Maybach Exelero in 2003. It consisted of Mercedes-Benz
engineers, who assumed responsibility for the engineering, of designers headed by Prof. Harald Leschke
as well as two professors and four students from the Transportation Design department of Pforzheim
Technical College. Nine months later, the draft of one of the students was selected for realization from a
line-up of promising design proposals.<br><br> This student had succeeded in creating the most elegant
The Exelero was based on the Maybach 57. However, the twelve-cylinder engine used in the Maybach
sedan was not powerful enough for the envisaged top speed, despite its two turbochargers.<br><br> Therefore,
displacement was enlarged from 5.6 to 5.9 litres, and turbocharging was optimised. As a result, a power
output of just under 515 kW (700 hp) and torque of around 1,000 newton metres were measured on
the test rig – enough power for the car to reach the targeted 350 km/h mark.<br><br>
To give the car a top speed of over 200 km/h, as demanded by Fulda, the engineers installed a powerful
six-cylinder engine with 140 hp (103 kW). The top speed was equally made possible by an unusually low
drag coefficient of cd = 0.25 (as opposed to 0.6 customary for contemporary series-production cars).<br><br>
Another pre-condition was that the chassis was not to weigh more than 1.6 tons. However, the car was
used to a very limited extent due to the outbreak of the Second World War. It disappeared in the turmoil
of war and has since been missing.<br><br>
Fulda looks back on a long tradition of special cars for testing tyres and for introducing them to the
public The streamlined Maybach SW 38, designed in 1938 and supplied in 1939, was a response to
technical developments in those days, i.e. to the cars’ ever higher road speeds in the 1930s
